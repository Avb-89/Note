Upload an Image to Docker
Let’s upload the image we just created to Docker so that it’s accessible from the cloud. Log in using your Docker ID and password:

# docker login -u mydockerid -p mypassword

Use docker push to upload the image we created in the previous steps, replacing mydockerid with your Docker ID name:

# docker push mydockerid/windows-test-image

If you log in to Docker here, and click Repositories on the home screen, you should see the image you just pushed in the list.

In this article, I showed you how to pull a default Windows Server image from Docker, modify and build a new image, and upload it to a Docker repository.
